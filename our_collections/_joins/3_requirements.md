- **All new graduate students are required to finish at least two of the followings before joining the lab.** So please start working on one of them ASAP.

  - Homework assignments of [KAIST CS420: Compiler Design](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs420). Lecture videos are uploaded to YouTube, and you can ask questions in the course repository’s issue tracker.
  - Homework assignments of [KAIST CS431: Concurrent Programming](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs492-concur). Lecture videos are uploaded to YouTube, and you can ask questions in the course repository’s issue tracker.
  - Homework Assignments of [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) Volumes 1 and 2.
  - Reading the [Corundum](https://github.com/corundum/corundum) open-source FPGA-based NIC.

  **You’re also strongly encouraged to join the lab as an undergraduate intern** to see what’s actually going on in the lab.

- **Undergraduate interns don’t have any requirements.**

  We are widely open to all undergraduate students! If you want to join this lab as an intern, you’re going to do so. You are first going to do at least one of the above assignments, and then starting on research projects.
