- Don’t pretend to know something if you don’t.
  If you do that, then you’re losing an opportunity to (1) learn the knowledge; and (2) go deeper into the problem that leads to a great research topic. Cherish (and even foster) your ignorance. Don’t assume the others will look down on you if you don’t know something. I know people often do it, but it’s their bad.

  - Don’t say yes (or no) if you’re not sure about it.
  - Don’t say you understood something if you don’t.
  - You’re encouraged to say “I don’t get it” and “I don’t know that.”

- **Be faithful to the discussion.** If you disagree, say so; if you don’t like it, say so; if you’re happy with it, say so! But don’t try to *win* the argument. Research is not about winning and losing (especially within the same group). Try to summarize what you want to say (e.g., “Your idea doesn’t work in general”) and then substantiate your argument with evidences (e.g., “for instance, let’s look at this code: …”).

- **Don’t be angry or grumpy when the discussion is getting hotter.** Research and any other creative works require different opinions clashing with each other, or in other words, *hot discussions*. But they don’t need to be involved with emotions clashing with each other. I know it’s difficult to separate them out, but let’s try to do that.

- **Right after every discussion, write down and share a summary note** in the corresponding project stream in Zulip. For instance:

  ```python
    ## discussions
    def function():
      x = 10
      return "Hello"
  ```

  ## action items
    - jeehoon: contact D's authors
    - kyeongmin: investigate if B really matters, and document why A won't work in gitlab.
    - seungmin: implement C, make a schedule for the next meeting

  Please faithfully summarize discussions. Especially, be fair to the ideas you don’t agree with.
